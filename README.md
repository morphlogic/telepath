# telepath
Telepath is a distributed application for assistance in the investigation of potentially paranormal phenomena, specifically extrasensory perception. It allows members in a group to submit thoughts at specific times, after which Telepath identifies commonly conceived thoughts as candidates for further study in the context of telepathy.

Members belong to one or more ThinkGroups and submit Thoughts each pertaining to a particular Topic along with a time at which the thought occurred. Reports are generated regularly and on an ad hoc basis to highlight temporal and subjective commonalities between thoughts between Members of a ThinkGroup.
